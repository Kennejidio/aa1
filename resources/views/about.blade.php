                    <h4 class="text-center">JUDGE ELISEO N. LOPEZ</h4>
                    <p>Founder JUDGE ELISEO N. LOPEZ was born on February 29, 1912 in San Roque, San Manuel,
                        Pangasinan. He was the second child among the six children of Patricio Lopez, Sr. and
                        Eulogia Nitafan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coming from a poor family of parents who could not afford to send him to college, he left
                        his hometown and journeyed to the City of Manila and found himself a job to support his
                        studies. He worked as a gardener and janitor of the Delos Santos family, owner of the
                        University of Manila. He also worked as their family driver for some time until he was
                        assigned at the Registrar’s Office of the same university where he had settled himself as a
                        student in the College of Law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He passed the bar in 1940 and traveled with a college friend to Leyte where he met and
                        married Paula Alvero Bayot of Abuyog in 1941. They were blessed with five children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Armed with knowledge and determination, the couple declined to established a secondary
                        school for boys and girls whose parents could not afford to send their children to private
                        schools. In 1951, Abuyog Academy came into existence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He married after the early demise of his first wife. His second marriage to Birgita Pensona
                        gifted them with eleven children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He passed away on October 29, 1976 at the age of 64, leaving behind him a legacy worth
                        emulating, “affordable quality education for the less privileged.”

                    <h4 class="text-center"><b>BACKGROUND HISTORY OF ABUYOG ACADEMY</b></h4>
                    <h5 class="text-center">“I am The Fruit of the Dream”</h5>
                    <p>
                        And the dream started when Mrs. Paula Alvero Bayot-Lopez come home one day from
                        school disheartened. Apparently, she was not allowed to take her exams because she
                        fails to pay her school fees. She told her husband, Atty. Eliseo N. Lopez about the
                        incident came a question to herself, she asked, “If someone who had least or had
                        least or had some means of paying would little or no means at all?” So she asked her
                        husband “Why don’t we just put up a school?” The inflection was to get set up a
                        school that would be open even to students whose parents had little or no means of
                        sending their children to high school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Atty. Eliseo N. Lopez shared the scheme the same dream and agreed with her. He
                        started to call on the prominent families and benevolent individuals of Abuyog who
                        had the knowledge and experience in running a school. He also looked for students
                        most them were drop-out and out-of-school youth, to be his first students. Finally
                        in the year 1951, he found a building that would house the fulfilment of the dream.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first building was rented from Tupaz family in Real St. Brgy. Buntay.
                        Ironically, this was just in front of Manang Pauling’s old school. A couple of years
                        later, the school moved to its current location at Real St. Brgy. Bito.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sixty years later, the name of the school still hands strong. There had been a lot
                        of changes, all for the good of all stakeholders. The deep murky fish ponds at the
                        back of the school have long been gone. Hundreds of truckloads of soil had been
                        hauled and poured to level the ground. There is a great improvement in terms of the
                        physical plant- the old and dilapidated school building was topped down and paved
                        the way to the construction of two-story eight classroom school building. Likewise,
                        the back area is now the new quadrangle of the school where other school facilities,
                        classrooms, and offices are located.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legacy continues as the school gears towards development instruction and
                        offering affordable quality private secondary education to the coping to the needs
                        of this competitive world.

                    <p>
                        ABUYOG ACADEMY is private, non-sectarian high school founded by the late Judge
                        Eliseo N. Lopez in the year 1951 with the legacy worth emulating, “affordable
                        quality education for the less privileged.” It is located in Brgy. Bito Abuyog,
                        Leyte along the real street. At, present the school is manned by a dynamic school
                        administrator, Engr. Aida Lopez-Rinos as the school director. Likewise, the school
                        is employed by eligible and component teachers teaching the different subject areas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a valid fact, AA adheres to its philosophy to provide secondary education of low
                        income families in the municipality of Abuyog and its nearby, municipalities.
                        Comparing the amount of tuition fee of private high school in Abuyog and Javier, AA
                        still offers low tuition fee than these private high schools. Hence, it is one of
                        the school’s objectives to provide quality education through affordable and low
                        tuition fee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The school is a reciepient of Government Assistance to Students and Teachers in
                        Private Education (GASTPE) under the ESC Program thereby giving an opportunity to
                        incoming Grade 7 students to enroll and to study a private school where the
                        government pays the tuition fee of the grantee until they graduate.
